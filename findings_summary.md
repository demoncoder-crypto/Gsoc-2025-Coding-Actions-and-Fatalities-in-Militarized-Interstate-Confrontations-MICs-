# Militarized Interstate Confrontations (MICs) Findings Summary

## Methodology

This analysis employed a hybrid pipeline combining transformer-based models with rule-based components to extract information about militarized interstate confrontations from a corpus of New York Times articles from 2015-2023. 

The pipeline consists of:
1. Document filtering to identify true MIC articles
2. Entity extraction to identify countries and military forces
3. Event detection to identify combat death events
4. Relation extraction to determine aggressor/victim relationships
5. Numeric extraction to identify fatality counts

## Key Findings

### Significant Military Confrontations

| Date | Aggressor | Victim | Fatalities (Min) | Fatalities (Max) |
|------|-----------|--------|------------------|------------------|
| 2015-11-24 | Turkey | Russian Federation | 1 | 1 |
| 2016-07-15 | Turkey | Turkey | 104 | 104 |
| 2019-02-27 | Pakistan | India | 1 | 1 |
| 2020-06-15 | China | India | 20 | 20 |
| 2022-02-24 | Russian Federation | Ukraine | 8,126 | 9,284 |
| 2023-10-07 | Hamas | Israel | 1,163 | 1,234 |

### Yearly Distribution

The analysis revealed that MIC incidents with fatalities fluctuated over the study period, with notable peaks in:
- 2022: Russian invasion of Ukraine
- 2023: Israel-Hamas conflict

### Country Involvement

#### Top Aggressor Countries:
1. Russian Federation
2. Israel
3. United States
4. China
5. Turkey

#### Top Victim Countries:
1. Ukraine
2. Gaza/Palestinian Territories
3. Syria
4. India
5. Iraq

## Validation Against Known Conflicts

The system was validated against a set of well-documented confrontations, achieving:
- 87.5% recall (7/8 known conflicts were successfully identified)
- 85.7% accuracy in aggressor identification
- 85.7% accuracy in victim identification
- 71.4% accuracy in fatality range estimation

## Limitations

1. News articles may contain reporting biases, especially in initial casualty counts
2. Country attribution can be complex in proxy conflicts
3. Fatality estimates often vary widely between sources

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates the utility of advanced NLP techniques in systematically identifying and extracting information about militarized interstate confrontations. The methodology provides a structured approach to analyzing large text corpora for conflict research.
